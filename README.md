### Overview
This project explores the design of a mental wellness mobile app that helps students and teens manage emotions, track mood patterns, and receive personalized AI-driven recommendations.
The goal was to create a calming, supportive experience that encourages daily reflection and healthy mental habits.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and teens often experience stress, anxiety, and emotional overwhelm but lack simple tools to track emotions or understand their mental patterns.
Existing wellness apps feel complicated, unrelatable, or inconsistent in providing personalized help.

## 👥 Target Audience

Students (ages 14–22)

Teens with academic pressure, low motivation, or mood instability

First-time mental wellness app users who prefer simplicity over depth

## 🔍 Research
### 1. Secondary Research

I studied common emotional challenges among teens:

High screen time → low focus

Academic stress

Social pressure

Lack of daily mindfulness habits

### 2. Quick User Survey (Google Form)

The survey included 5 short questions around stress, habits, and what users would want in a wellness app.
Key findings:

82% struggle with stress at least 3–4 times a week

Users prefer emoji-based mood logging

They want personalized suggestions, not just data

Journaling feels “too long,” so micro-journaling is preferred

### 3. Insights

Users want support that feels quick, friendly, and calming

Daily notifications motivate consistency

Visual mood trends help them understand emotional patterns

## 🧠 User Persona

Name: Aanya, 17
Goal: Reduce stress during exams, build emotional awareness
Pain Points: Bad concentration, overthinking, no habit of tracking moods
Needs: Quick check-ins, easy suggestions, positive reinforcement

## 💡 Key Features
### 1. AI-Based Mood Suggestions

After logging a mood, the app suggests:

Breathing exercises

Short breaks

Journaling prompts

Music recommendations

Encouraging messages

### 2. Mood Logging (Emoji-Based)

Quick 5-second mood input

Optional micro-journal (“1–2 lines only”)

### 3. Weekly Mood Insights

Smooth graphs

Pattern recognition

“Your top emotion this week” summaries

### 4. Daily Affirmations

Calming cards with simple quotes to boost positivity.

## 🗺️ User Flow

Onboarding → Mood Check-in → AI Suggestions → Journal → Insights Dashboard

This ensures clarity and prevents overwhelming new users.

## ✏️ Wireframing

I started with low-fidelity wireframes to define:

Simple bottom navigation

Spacious layouts

Minimal text + friendly illustrations

The goal was to remove clutter and create a “safe, gentle” environment.

## 🧪 Usability Testing

I tested with 3–5 users and asked them to:

Log their mood

View suggestions

Read insights

### Feedback:

Users loved emojis for mood input

Requested shorter suggestions

Wanted a simple “streak tracker” for motivation

Refinements were made to reduce clutter and shorten suggestions.
